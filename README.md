# SAGI Observational Astronomy School
in Collaboration with Cardiff University

The school is a two-week summer school that brings astronomers and students together to work on observational aspects of astronomy. The program run for 2 weeks, hosted by SAGI and the Quy Nhon Observatory, and Cardiff University. The school focuses on practical skills designed for observations, operation, and instrumentation development. Our approach will also demonstrate how astronomy is not only interesting, but also critical for both, technological and scientific development. This approach is partly motivated by frequently asked questions on the need for astronomy, the study of celestial objects. “The subject seems so far removed from our daily life, so why do we study it or why should the government invest in it?”  

The program will teach astronomy and astrophysics, and the observational projects we undertake will focus on the fundamental questions, both scientifically and experimentally. The students will learn how to operate telescopes, how to go about designing and testing scientific instruments. The student will learn to conduct their observations the way professional astronomers do. They will experience the frustration of operating the telescope, the joy of getting it to work – to align the telescope, to focus and to point and track the entire instrument – the disappointment due to bad weather, the excitement of capturing the celestial images, the confusion of the data, and the power of analytical thinking and data analysis.

The topics for the school will include, telescope optics and practical astronomy (how to collimate a telescope, how to focus your instrument? how to point and track your telescope), and observations of fundamental astronomy, such as the measurement of Mars orbit and Keppler’s Law, and the discovery of Planet Neptune thru gravitational perturbation, etc. We also want to try conduct other topics such as: variability and transist observations, the discovery of Andromeda Galaxy and the scale of cosmological distance. Depending on the availability of resources and hardware, we might also try to study Big Bang Cosmology, with measurements of the cosmic microwave background. 

Students will also have chance to visit the Explora Science museum and the planetarium inside the campus any time.

## Date
10-23 July 2023

## Place
https://explorascience.vn/?lang=en
Quy Nhon, Vietnam

## Travel
It is better to book the international and domestic portions separately.  There are two main international airports in Vietnam : Hanoi (Noi Bai airport : HAN) and Ho Chi Minh (Tan Son Nhut airport : SGN). After SGN or HAN, you can fly to Quy Nhon by domestic flights or trains.

We will arrange the pickup from airport to hotel, the drive is about 45mins. In order to welcome you and organize your transfer from Quy Nhon airport to the conference hotel, please inform us of your flight number as well as the date and the arrival time in Quy nhon.

## Lecturers

Nguyen Luong Quang (American University of Paris, France)

Nicolas Peretto (Cardiff University, United Kingdom) - TBC

## Local Organizing Committee

## Participants
The program welcome 10 students from Cardiff University and 10 students Vietnamese universities. Vietnamese students who are searching for a place to host their thesis are also welcomed and are encouraged to discuss with the organizer first. 

## Logistics

## Accommodation
Will be arranged in shared rooms at the institute dormitory or hotels.

## Program
Students will attend common lectures, work in groups of five students under our supervision, and presented their progress in the two Friday’s afternoons.
