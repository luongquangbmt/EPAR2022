# EPAR2022

The EPAR at TNU brings astronomers and students together to work on specific research topics in astrophysics. The program run for 2 weeks, hosted by TNU. The program welcomed
students from all parts of Vietnam who are senior undergraduate students or graduate students searching for research experiences. Vietnamese students who are searching for a place to host
their dissertations are also welcomed. Participants can come for a shorter period or for the whole duration of the program, and are encouraged to come back year after year. Three visiting
scientists and nine students teamed up and conduct common research projects. The projects were designed such that they can be sub-divided into individual sub-projects and
tailored to match with the availability of the supervisor that year. Each week, scientists were responsible for the scientific theme and student supervision. Students presented their progress
in the two Fridayâ€™s afternoons.
