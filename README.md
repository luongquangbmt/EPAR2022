# SAGI Observational Astronomy School

The school is a two-week summer school that brings astronomers and students together to work on observational aspects of astronomy. The program run for 2 weeks, hosted by SAGI, Explora and Cardiff University. The school focuses on practical skills designed for observations, operation, and instrumentation development. Our approach will also demonstrate how astronomy is not only interesting, but also critical for both, technological and scientific development. This approach is partly motivated by frequently asked questions on the need for astronomy, the study of celestial objects. “The subject seems so far removed from our daily life, so why do we study it or why should the government invest in it?”  

The program will teach astronomy and astrophysics, and the observational projects we undertake will focus on the fundamental questions, both scientifically and experimentally. The students will learn how to operate telescopes, how to go about designing and testing scientific instruments. The student will learn to conduct their observations the way professional astronomers do. They will experience the frustration of operating the telescope, the joy of getting it to work – to align the telescope, to focus and to point and track the entire instrument – the disappointment due to bad weather, the excitement of capturing the celestial images, the confusion of the data, and the power of analytical thinking and data analysis.

The topics for the school will include, telescope optics and practical astronomy (how to collimate a telescope, how to focus your instrument? how to point and track your telescope), and observations of fundamental astronomy, such as the measurement of Mars orbit and Keppler’s Law, and the discovery of Planet Neptune thru gravitational perturbation, etc. We also want to try conduct a third topic: the discovery of Andromeda Galaxy and the scale of cosmological distance. Depending on the availability of resources and hardware, we might also try to study Big Bang Cosmology, with measurements of the cosmic microwave background. 

Students will also have chance to visit the Science museum and the planetarium inside the campus any time.

## Participants
This year, the program welcome 10 undegraduate students from Cardiff University, UK, and 10 students from all parts of Vietnam. Vietnamese students who are searching for a place to host their thesis are also welcomed and are encouraged to discuss with the organizer first.
