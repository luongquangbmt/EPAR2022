# SAGI Observational Astronomy School

The school focus on practical skills designed for instrumentation development and operation. Our approach will also demonstrate how astronomy is not only interesting, but also critical for both, technological and scientific development. This approach is partly motivated by frequently asked questions on the need for astronomy, the study of celestial objects. “The subject seems so far removed from our daily life, so why do we study it or why should the government invest in it?” The answers to this question are many, we should list here the three key points that are also relevant to our approach of summer school. 

1. Modern science originated from astronomy. Many fundamental and historical scientific discoveries were made through the study of astronomy, such as the motion of Mars that leads to the heliocentric system, and eventually to Newton’s theory of gravitation. Or the discovery of new planets using perturbation of their orbital motions, such as Neptune. It’s a wonderful and effective tool for science education. People want to know how such discoveries were made, and that is often how they are motivated to pursue science in the first place. 
2. Many modern technologies originated from the study of astronomy: CCD and smartphone cameras are just the latest examples. These devices were originally developed to replace camera film, in order for astronomers to take better pictures of the sky, and they can analyze the data using computer image processing. 
3. Astronomy continues to offer new and exciting discoveries of the Universe. We learn about the expansion of the Universe, the Big Bang, dark matter, dark energy. These discoveries are relatively new, ie., our ancestors from only a hundred years ago didn’t know about them. These discoveries are uniquely accessible to astronomy and not with any other branch of sciences. We believe the program we are proposing, called Astronomical Techniques, will encompass these three key points. The program will teach astronomy and astrophysics, and the observational projects we undertake will focus on the fundamental questions, both scientifically and experimentally. The students will learn how to operate telescopes, how to go about designing and testing scientific instruments. The student will learn to conduct their observations the way professional astronomers do. They will experience the frustration of operating the telescope, the joy of getting it to work – to align the telescope, to focus and to point and track the entire instrument – the disappointment due to bad weather, the excitement of capturing the celestial images, the confusion of the data, and the power of analytical thinking and data analysis.

The topics for the school will include, telescope optics and practical astronomy (how to collimate a telescope, how to focus your instrument? how to point and track your telescope), and observations of fundamental astronomy, such as the measurement of Mars orbit and Keppler’s Law, and the discovery of Planet Neptune thru gravitational perturbation. We also want to try conduct a third topic: the discovery of Andromeda Galaxy and the scale of cosmological distance. Depending on the availability of resources and hardware, we might also try to study Big Bang Cosmology, with measurements of the cosmic microwave background. 



The school is a two-week summer school that brings astronomers and students together to work on observational aspects of astronomy. The program run for 2 weeks, hosted by SAGI, Explora and Cardiff University.

## Facilities


## Participants
This year, the program welcome 10 undegraduate students from Cardiff University, UK, and 10 students from all parts of Vietnam. Vietnamese students who are searching for a place to host their thesis are also welcomed and are encouraged to discuss with the organizer first. 


## Program
Each week, scientists were responsible for the scientific theme and student supervision. Students presented their progress in the two Friday’s afternoons.

### Week 1



### Weekend Camp: Sky Quality Observation in a remote mountain
In the weekend, we will travel to a remote mountain with portable telescopes with DIMM software and conduct 1 or 2 nights to characterise the sky quality of the area that we visit.

### Week 2
